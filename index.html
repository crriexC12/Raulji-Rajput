      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-indigo-700">🏰 Historical Note</h2>
      <p>The honorific <em>“Raulji”</em>⚔️ "Guja ago, there was a powerful ruler named King Gajsingh of Godhra. He passed away in Samvat 245 (around 1189 AD). After his death, his son Prince Kahanadevji (I) became the ruler in Samvat 246.

King Kahanadevji had two queens. His first and eemqueen gave birth to a son named Vachankdevji, while his second wife, Vandevi, gave birth to another son named Chachankdevji.

Many years later, when King Kahanadevji died in Samvat 297, the throne was given to Chachankdevji, the younger son. This decision upset the elder son, Vachankdevji, because he felt he should have been the rightful heir to the throne. A dispute began between the two brothers.

However, instead of fighting, they decided to resolve the issue peacefully. As part of their agreement, Vachankdevji received control over 325 villages located near Anand and Vidyanagar, and he established his own ruling seat at Bakrol. He also retained control over an area called Mahida, which became known as his ilakab (estate or territory).

After becoming the main ruler, Chachankdevji started using the royal title “Rawal”, which was a mark of royal status and pride. To honor this title, Vachankdevji and his descendants began using the respectful form “Rawalji.”

As time passed, the titles “Mahida” (from Vachankdevji’s territory) and “Rawalji” (from the royal title) gradually turned into family surnames. These surnames were proudly carried forward by their descendants.

Over many generations, the name “Rawalji” slowly evolved in pronunciation and spelling to become “Raulji.”

Even today, families with the surnames Raulji and Mahida belong to the Solanki Rajput (also called Darbar) community. These families are mainly found in the regions of Kheda, Anand, Panchmahal, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, and nearby areas of Gujarat"
